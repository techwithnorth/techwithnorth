Homelab is a place when you can do a lot tinkering without any worries that you can brake something in the real world. It does not need to anything big. You can start with your own pc / laptop and level 2 hypervisor like Oracle VirtualBox, VmWare Workstation / Player or Hyper-V. You can also use some other pc stuff that is laing aroud, for example miniPC, ThinClient, RaspberryPi or some clone of it. I started with a rpi and from there it was getting bigger and bigger.
